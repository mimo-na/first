Episode 14

5
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,770
Hey. I heard that Im Ju Gyeong came to school bare-faced.

6
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,130
But do you think it's true she's dating Lee Su Ho?

7
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,370
Seeing her bare face earlier, it looked a lot worse than the picture.

8
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,210
He probably broke up after seeing her bare face. How can you date someone with that face?

9
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,250
Isn't Lee Su Ho out these days, too? His dad is totally out.

10
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,460
Maybe he's lost it and is dating anybody.

11
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,710
Wow, that's harsh.

12
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,110
Hey, let's go.

13
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,270
Hey, what's this? Hey, hey, hey.

14
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,880
Hey, you guys! Take back what you just said.

15
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,670
Im Ju Gyeong?

16
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,800
Walking around bare-faced, you must be crazy.

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,480
That's right, I'm dating Lee Su Ho.

18
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,570
Lee Su Ho is my boyfriend!

19
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,690
Happy? Does that resolve your curiosity?

20
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,860
- I think she's crazy.
- I think you're right.

21
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,030
He doesn't discriminate against people for their looks.

22
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,000
And he likes me as who I am no matter how I look.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,890
So he's so much better than you guys with ruined personalities.

24
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,820
So don't gossip about him to drag him down just because we're dating,

25
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,430
and come and talk to me personally from now on.

26
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,290
I will counter every single thing, got it?

27
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,790
And rather than evaluating people's looks, go and study during that time!

28
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,000
Get out of my way!

29
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,730
It must be true.

30
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,450
I'm so jealous.

31
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,570
♫ Love so fine ♫

32
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,160
♫ Come closer, approach me ♫

33
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,220
♫ Lean in my arms ♫

34
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,940
♫ Always in my heart. I think I’m in love with you ♫

35
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,570
♫ Love so fine ♫

36
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,240
♫ You’re so right ♫

37
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,210
♫ Your lovely look ♫

38
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,430
Let's go.
♫ I'm going to spend all the time with you ♫

39
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,860
♫ I don't want to let go of even a moment ♫

40
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,030
♫ Stay with me like this ♫

41
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,490
Hi, what should we go eat today?

42
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,430
- Tteokbooki. There was a good place.
- Really?

43
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,040
Lover? I definitely don't have one.

44
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,500
Wow, your car is nice. Your job must be going well.

45
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,100
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

46
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,080
Shall I give it to you?

47
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,600
You're cute.

48
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,390
You should be my grapefruit from now on.

49
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,430
I'm the grapefruit!

50
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,100
You scared me.

51
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,570
I want to eat some grapefruit.

52
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,060
It's because I like grapefruits.

53
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,340
- They really must be dating.
- Ah, I envy her.

54
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,770
It looks like our secret dating is over now.

55
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,820
Yeah. Today, I came out with my bare face and my dating life.

56
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,360
Are you okay?

57
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,930
No. It feels like my heart became as small as a bean.

58
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,570
Then you should have come like how you normally do.

59
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,720
Last time, Go Woon told me this.

60
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,540
That if I dislike my face just because people are cursing at me,

61
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,960
then I'm acknowledging that I'm ugly.

62
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,890
So from now on, I'm only going to listen to those who like me.

63
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,440
The words that people who don't know me well say easily...

64
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,830
I won't bother with them.

65
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,440
I won't run or hide anymore.

66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,900
So that's why I came bare-faced.

67
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,860
You're all grown up, Im Ju Gyeong.

68
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,770
Yeah, Mom. Noona is fine.

69
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,040
God Su Ho is also next to her.

70
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,000
What? God Su Ho?

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,420
- Don't worry.
- There aren't any kids who are bullying her?

72
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,740
I don't have to charge in, do I?

73
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,410
Okay.

74
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,240
Did he say Ju Gyeong is okay?

75
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,250
Seems like she's doing fine from what he's saying,

76
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,120
but we don't know how she's really feeling.

77
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,060
She'll be all right. Whose daughter is she?

78
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,930
Why did you come here?

79
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,010
Leave!

80
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,200
Leave! Leave!

81
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,740
Leave?  U-U-Us?

82
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,160
Instead of shaking the heart of someone who's not doing anything! Leave! Leave!

83
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,080
What kind of crazy person?

84
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,980
Teacher Han?

85
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,390
T-Teacher?

86
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,450
Hello.

87
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,720
This is a no-parking zone.

88
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,830
But because you parked here, I was upset.

89
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,020
Goodbye.

90
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,300
Why did he get so riled over parking?

91
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,190
Does he have some anger management disorder?

92
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,870
No. A cute control disorder.

93
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,600
- Huh? What the...?
- Oh, wow!

94
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,570
- Whoa!
- Wow, hurray!

95
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,060
What is going on?  What's this?

96
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,340
- Wow.
- This is awesome!

97
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,830
Ah, seriously.

98
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,270
I'm seriously so jealous.

99
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,720
Ju Gyeong, I worried a lot.

100
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,010
But you were kind of cool back there.
[- Hye Min]

101
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,480
Hello.

102
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,840
- Time for dismissal, kids.
- You mean morning announcement.

103
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,340
Of course.

104
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,360
The student who isn't a part of our class should leave now.

105
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,260
Mr. Han, that's Im Ju Gyeong.

106
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,060
She probably is.

107
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,300
- Ju Gyeong?
- Yes?

108
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,240
You're Ju Gyeong?

109
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,000
- Yes.
- Ju Gyeong...

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,480
Ju Gyeong, welcome back.

111
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,640
Never mind.

112
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,140
I... Ju Gyeong... I... to Ju Gyeong...You...

113
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,100
I worried a lot about Ju Gyeong.

114
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,030
Is Teacher crying?

115
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,870
Don't cry.

116
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,030
Is he really crying?

117
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,160
Guys, I'm sorry.

118
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,260
Ju Gyeong has finally returned!

119
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,800
Don't cry!

120
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,040
Don't cry! Don't cry!

121
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm really sorry.

122
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,540
Ju Gyeong— That's it!

123
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,900
What the...?

124
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,000
How could you think about coming here looking like that?

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,920
What'd you say?

126
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,320
It's not like you're putting on a show for the whole school.

127
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,380
You wanted to receive attention this way?

128
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,400
It looks like since Lee Su Ho is next to you, you gained courage that was nonexistent before.

129
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,500
Hey, Kang Su Jin!

130
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,960
- You really...!
- Su Ah...

131
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,940
Kang Su Jin, you're seriously the worst.

132
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,220
It wouldn't have been enough for you to kneel before Ju Gyeong and beg, but what'd you say?

133
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,020
- Have you said everything?
- Why do I have to beg before her?

134
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,790
You're the one who spread Ju Gyeong's video on the bulletin board!

135
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,950
- Someone stop him.
- Where are they going?

136
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,040
- Should I stop him?
- What's wrong with him?

137
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,470
- Should I stop him?
- Hey, where are you going?

138
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,960
Im Ju Gyeong... You think you destroyed her, don't you?

139
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,070
The one who's been destroyed is you.

140
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,030
That's right. At first, I tried to understand you.

141
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,260
That maybe you did it impulsively out of jealousy because you liked Lee Su Ho.

142
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,090
If so, then at least you would be regretting it by now.

143
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,130
Because Ju Gyeong hasn't been coming to school,

144
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,780
that you would, although late, feel sorry and worry about her.

145
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,870
That's what I thought.

146
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,990
So... I was waiting for you to apologize to her first.

147
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,550
But... you were this kind of person?

148
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,630
Yeah, turns out I am this type of person.

149
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,040
Su Ah!

150
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,370
Su Ah!

151
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,400
Kang Su Jin, for what reason are you going this far to ruin everything?

152
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,260
Is something going on at home? Is it because of your dad?

153
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,700
What's it to you?

154
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,600
Because no matter how much I think about it, I'm not getting an answer.

155
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,230
You weren't originally this type of person.

156
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,960
Is this really what you wanted?

157
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,640
- Yeah.
- I know it's not. I also know you're going to regret it.

158
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,770
But even if it's now, you should go and apologize to Ju Gyeong.

159
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,650
- Apologize and—
- Don't concern yourself.

160
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,040
Su Ah!

161
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,620
Wait a moment Su Ah!

162
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,360
- I'm sorry.
- Let go of me.

163
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,430
I'm really sorry that I couldn't tell you.

164
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,610
But I didn't tell you because I thought you wouldn't be my friend anymore.

165
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,240
Hey, Im Ju Gyeong. What do you see me as?

166
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,320
Did you even think of me as your best friend?

167
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,870
That's why I couldn't tell you even more.

168
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,260
But you told Su Jin.

169
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,180
You only told her and didn't tell me anything.

170
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,000
Did you think I wouldn't be your friend anymore if I saw your bare face?

171
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,120
No matter how thoughtless I look,

172
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,670
how could you see me as that kind of person?

173
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,300
Su Ah, I'm sorry.

174
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,130
I made all that fuss trying to get you a boyfriend.

175
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,300
You also didn't tell me you were dating Lee Su Ho.

176
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,050
Do I have to find out about your boyfriend through the bulletin board as your best friend?

177
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,610
I'm sorry, Su Ah.

178
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,460
What could have made her become like that?

179
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,520
It's not that she was made to be like that but that she chose to become like that.

180
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,570
How could she do something like that?

181
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,060
Kang Su Jin let go of our hands.

182
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,920
To her, you and I...

183
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,400
were just to this extent.

184
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,730
Let me see your face properly.

185
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,130
What's with your face that you had to tightly secure it...?

186
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,470
You'll become prettier if you take care of your skin.

187
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,250
Go to the dermatologist and get treated.

188
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,410
Drink a lot of water and eat vitamins.

189
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,170
Then that's it! Don't worry.

190
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,810
And... You have to tell me everything from the beginning to the end.

191
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,030
When did you start dating Lee Su Ho? Who confessed first? Does he treat you well?

192
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,600
Is Lee Su Ho, that psychopath, being short-tempered or anything like that?

193
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,930
He isn't.

194
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,060
What did you do well that you're smiling? You have to tell me everything from the beginning.

195
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,540
Everything, everything, everything! We're going to stay up all night, okay?

196
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,560
This... What's the meaning of it?

197
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,970
Hey, take it off. So dirty.

198
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,100
Was it not because you had feelings for me?

199
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,880
What are you saying?

200
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,790
I'm asking you for the last time.

201
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,460
Was it not because you thought of accepting me even a little bit?

202
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,330
- It wasn't.
- No! Give me evidence.

203
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:00,990
You really don't have feelings for me? Then step on me and go.

204
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,300
You have to think well.

205
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,430
I told you this is the last time—

206
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,960
I have no intention of staying as a friend like a fool

207
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,370
and having a heartbroken one-sided love like you.

208
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,660
Hey. Are you okay?

209
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,920
Are you crying?

210
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,660
It didn't look like you got hit that hard though.

211
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,160
Hyung! What should I do?

212
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,230
What do you mean?

213
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,710
Did you get rejected by Go Woon?

214
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:06,510
I really like her, but she says I'm not in her heart.

215
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,420
When I look at her, she's so pretty and I get so nervous.

216
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,020
How can I just be friends with her?

217
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,870
- That's true.
- If she comes to me, I have confidence that I'll treat her well.

218
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:24,930
- That's right.
- I didn't know a one-sided love would be this hard.

219
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,900
Who would've known?

220
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,050
But did you know?

221
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,690
That the person who has done everything he could do has no regrets either.

222
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,570
Because I properly confessed to her once and was rejected...

223
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,780
I think I now am able to sort out my feelings.

224
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,250
Oh! When did you guys start dating?

225
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,770
It hasn't been long.

226
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,250
They started dating since the field trip.

227
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,330
Since then? Wow, you seriously!

228
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,570
Hyeon Gyu's Patch would like to ask you a question.

229
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,830
When did you kiss for the first time?

230
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,130
At the field trip—

231
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,020
Why'd you ask that?

232
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,900
Seriously.

233
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,740
- Even I know that wasn't right.
- You guys all hate it if I even speak one word, right?

234
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,060
In order to have a flower bloom on the shaking tree branch,

235
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,490
the snow must have ceaselessly challenged itself.

236
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,830
Crunch, crunch. It must have knocked.

237
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,160
Flutter, flutter. It must have danced.

238
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,060
It must have slipped hundreds of times.

239
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,730
Look at the beauty of finally succeeding in blooming.

240
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,770
In spring, on the spot where it once burned,

241
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,030
The branch sprouts the most beautiful scar in the world.

242
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,290
On the spot where it once burned,

243
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,900
It sprouts the most beautiful scar in the world.

244
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,970
- How is it?
- It's nice.

245
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,510
- Tired?
- Yeah.

246
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,730
I couldn't sleep well. This won't do.

247
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm going to the music room first and sleep. You should eat and then come.

248
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,000
How can I? Then you go on, I'll buy some things to eat.

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,520
No, it's okay...

250
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:30,840
♫ I just don't have the courage ♫

251
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,780
♫ I'm afraid it will be too much for you ♫

252
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:45,060
♫ I'm always anxious ♫

253
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:51,350
♫ I am loving you ♫

254
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,860
♫ Fall in you ♫

255
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,510
♫ I just found out ♫

256
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,700
♫ Fall in you ♫

257
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,650
♫ I am waiting for you ♫

258
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,920
♫ Fall in you ♫

259
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,390
♫ You are my destiny ♫

260
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,300
♫ The one person who will be my star ♫

261
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:27,000
♫ The one person whom I want to give my everything ♫

262
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,710
♫ You ♫

263
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,190
Who is it?

264
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,670
You woke up?

265
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,260
When did you come?

266
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,480
I woke up because of you.

267
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,140
My goodness, you must have been really tired.

268
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,630
Lee Su Ho's cousin.

269
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,970
I didn't mean to fool you.

270
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,000
Who was fooled?

271
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,670
You and Lee Su Ho are really obvious when you guys lie.

272
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,430
What? You knew then?

273
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,370
Why? What are you going to say?

274
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,310
You're similar with and without it.

275
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,700
What do they mean by they were deceived?

276
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,020
I can't understand.

277
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,690
- Thanks for the comfort.
- I'm saying both are ugly.

278
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,770
Are you teasing me?

279
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,010
But I heard that you were the one who took down my anonymous bulletin board video.

280
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,600
Thanks.

281
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,650
No problem.

282
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,260
Couple item. I'm so jealous.

283
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,520
I wish I also had a girlfriend.

284
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,970
Are you going on a date today? Where are you going?

285
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,150
Shall I tell you some of the popular places for dates?

286
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,400
I also know how to search it up.

287
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,820
The places that come up after searching are all advertisements.

288
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,420
There are a bunch of places that girls hate when you actually take them there.

289
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,820
This friend doesn't know a single thing about dating.

290
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,010
Is that so?

291
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,640
Where? Where? Let's see what you found.

292
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,440
Let's see.

293
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,850
- How is it?
- Uh...

294
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,280
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

295
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,360
- You tried.
- You tried, you tried.

296
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,900
- Wait, wait. What is this?
♫ I like you so much, what do I do? What do I do?

297
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,010
♫ You're so beautiful, what do I do? What do I do?

298
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,420
Hey!

299
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,090
Yo, cutie. You had a plan for everything. You're hard on the outside, but soft on the inside.

300
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,380
You're so soft.

301
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,150
- What do I do, what do I do?
- What do I do, what do I do?

302
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,550
- Be quiet.
- What do I do, what do I do?

303
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,240
- Our softy.
- Ju Gyeong!

304
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,170
What do I do, what do I do?

305
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,540
- Ju Gyeong!
- Huh?

306
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,180
I'm taking her home today.

307
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,250
Sorry. I'll call you later.

308
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,140
♫ What to do with this? What to do, what to do?

309
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,380
♫ Shall we play with you? What to do, what to do?

310
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,010
♫ Shall we play with you? What to do, what to do?

311
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:14,550
♫ What to do, what to do?

312
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,880
Wow, this album picture is so cool. What do I do?

313
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,010
Wow, how long has it been since Crash's last song? What do I do?

314
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:32,560
It's unexpected of you who looks so adorable to like this kind of hardcore music.

315
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,150
- Please give us two corn dogs.
- That looks tasty.

316
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,560
Thank you.

317
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,370
Thank you.

318
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,020
Shall we see what's in Hye Min's backpack?

319
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,070
- It hurts a bit.
- It hurts?

320
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,920
- Will you hit her for me?
- I'll kill her for you.

321
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,790
What? Did they just drag someone from our school?

322
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,790
Im Ju, where are you going?

323
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,740
- Hey, Ju Gyeong! Im Ju Gyeong!
- I'm hungry.

324
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,350
- Please give me five corn dogs.
- Wait up. Let's go together.

325
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,110
Add five spicy rice cakes too.

326
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,700
More, more!

327
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,520
Left foot, left foot!

328
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,290
- When are you going home?
- Hey, quiet down.

329
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,850
Can you not talk to us when we're at an important moment?

330
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,850
Ah, seriously.

331
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,800
How much money do you have, Hye Min?

332
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,280
- What?
- You said you wouldn't look for me.

333
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,860
That you would let me go.

334
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,730
That's if you had dug up dirt on Im Ju Gyeong.

335
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,640
You didn't do anything. Is that not so?

336
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,360
Hey, Park Sae Mi!

337
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,810
- Im Ju Gyeong?
- It's our dumpling.

338
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:04,950
We were going to go see you anyway, but we meet like this.

339
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,010
Let go of Hye Min.

340
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,570
What if I don't want to?

341
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,330
Ju Hye Min, come here.

342
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,410
Where are you going?

343
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,780
Ju Gyeong!

344
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,820
You're dating Lee Su Ho and having Han Seo Jun by your side. You sure grew up a lot.

345
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,840
But I heard the video and picture got spread on the  bulletin board?

346
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,970
Your life got ruined. What to do? It's not like you can be reborn.

347
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,630
Hey!

348
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,340
This...

349
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,480
This crazy person, do you really want to die?!

350
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,220
In your own words, you guys are dead today.

351
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,410
You're low, waving around a weapon!

352
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,770
Hey, does your mom know you're going around like this?

353
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:03,100
Don't mess with my mom. Cham, cham, cham. Head!

354
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,480
You grew up a lot.

355
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,370
What are you carrying around?

356
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,900
Ah, that hurts!

357
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,530
Cunning bitch.

358
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,690
You're dead.

359
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,640
Left foot, right foot.

360
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,570
Okay!

361
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,230
This dumpling bitch.

362
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,400
Who are you trying to fool?

363
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,350
Arm, arm!

364
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,980
Hey, give it to me.

365
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,970
Wow, so you want to challenge me?

366
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,470
I'll accept that challenge. Bring it on, Lee Su Ho.

367
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,690
Su Ho, go go!

368
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,420
Hey!

369
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,050
Hey, hey!

370
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,600
Bye, Hyeon Gyu.

371
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,750
Let go! Let go!

372
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,240
What are you guys doing? Get off!

373
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,730
Hey, let go.

374
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,240
Oi, Brother!

375
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,440
Which b**ches and jerk are messing with my Saebom friends?

376
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,440
Hey, I'll take care of this. You guys should go.

377
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,050
Thanks, Ju Gyeong.

378
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,960
From now on, never go with them.

379
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,230
If they try to take you, call the police right away, okay?

380
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,860
But I'm not afraid of Sae Mi anymore.

381
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,420
She wasn't much of anything earlier.

382
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,510
Why was I scared all this time?

383
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,420
I should have stood up to them sooner.

384
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,480
That's true. I should have also done it sooner.

385
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,790
I just got it today. Oh no!

386
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,830
Guys, sorry I couldn't protect you. It hurt a lot, right?

387
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,890
- Oh no.
- What do I do?

388
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,380
Do you want this? I usually buy two at a time.

389
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,090
Are you really giving this to me?

390
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,120
Thank you so much!

391
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,340
I'll buy you something delicious.

392
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,690
By the way, are you a Gelatin, too?

393
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,460
Yup, the third group of Gelatin. What about you?

394
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,770
- I'm the third group too.
- Really?

395
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,050
Awesome! Nice to know that!

396
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,180
Hey, did you succeed in getting the year-end concert tickets?

397
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,830
Yeah, section A standing.

398
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,410
- Awesome! I got section A, too.
- Really?

399
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:11,990
Yeah! We should go together. This is so great!

400
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,040
Enjoy the music.  By the way, what a shame to ruin this one...

401
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,870
The memory I never want to remember.

402
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:26,140
What's different is that I'm not alone now.

403
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,760
It's getting late.

404
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,070
To Girlfriend: Are you having fun?

405
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,240
Did you eat?
You're not answering your phone.

406
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,840
Should I come get you?
It's getting late.

407
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,210
You are a very tiring type.

408
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,760
Just eat. Why are you spying on my phone?

409
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,250
Let her let out her stress and have fun.

410
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,590
Why are you grilling her?

411
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,880
She'll call you on her way home.

412
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,470
This is an obsession. An obsession.

413
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,360
- I'm worried.
- I'm more worried about you.

414
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,130
I was just like that in the beginning of my relationship.

415
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,480
Every chance I got, I called and texted her.

416
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,080
In the end, I almost got dumped after a week.

417
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,760
- Su Ah told me I'm the tiring type.
- What?

418
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,560
- No matter how full of love you are, you should make her fret.
- Make her fret.

419
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,740
- So she doesn't get tired.
- So she doesn't get tired.

420
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,640
You should write this down.

421
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,000
You guys should go now. Leave quickly.

422
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,130
We have to finish this.

423
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,930
Su Ah, are you having fun?

424
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,830
I miss you so much!

425
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,860
I'll be right there to get you, Baby.

426
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,030
Hey, tiring... Not tiring.

427
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,450
Su Ho, I don't really know about relationships but what I think is—

428
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,340
Aren't you leaving?

429
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,790
I will try and eat very fast.

430
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,920
I should call Su Ho.

431
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,500
No.

432
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,190
Su Ah, Su Ah.

433
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,680
Hey, what do you want so late?

434
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,280
Send me a text right now. I think my phone is broken.

435
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,560
It's fine. It's totally fine!

436
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,180
If it's broken, how could you call me?

437
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,630
Seeing that I'm not getting any calls

438
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,320
- it's sending but I'm having problems receiving.
- You're so tiring.

439
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,330
Just go to bed. I'm going insane.

440
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,240
Hey, Yoo Tae Hoon.

441
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,870
Seriously!

442
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,270
Yoo Tae Hoon!

443
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,580
Is he still sleeping?

444
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,500
Girlfriend♡

445
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,630
I already cleaned the floor this morning. Stop it.

446
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,040
You're tired so I want to help out.

447
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,150
- Is there anything I can do?
- No.

448
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,030
Still. Should I sort these?

449
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,530
You're distracting me. Go home.

450
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,930
Mom, you know...

451
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,110
Just look under the chair.

452
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,470
- What?
- Just look as I said.

453
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,540
What is this?

454
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,110
Mom!

455
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,670
It looks like there are a lot of things to do like preparing for a performance test.

456
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,300
And it'll cost quite a bit to get all the materials.

457
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,910
How will you cover all that by working part-time?

458
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:32,390
Then are you giving me permission to pursue cosmetology?

459
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,240
Quit your work right away, too.

460
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,380
Since you've decided to do this, you should really work your butt off.

461
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,570
Become famous like that salad or Selena or something. Do you understand?

462
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,630
Mom!

463
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,850
What's wrong with you? Go away.

464
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:52,890
I'll really work hard. I love you, Mom.

465
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,910
- That tickles. It tickles.
- Thank you so much!

466
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,420
It tickles. Stop!

467
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,250
Im Ju Gyeong. Im Ju Gyeong!

468
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,080
- What.
- Why didn't you answer your phone yesterday? Why?!

469
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,700
I wanted to relieve some stress and have fun. Why are you grilling me?

470
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,860
You keep calling and texting. I want to be free now.

471
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,960
What do you mean? Are you saying we should break up?

472
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,560
You are really a tiring type.

473
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,250
What?

474
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,070
I'm not the tiring type.

475
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,910
- What do you think? You want to get on?
- Okay.

476
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,200
Don't get on. Don't go. Don't go!

477
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,380
Im Ju Gyeong. Im Ju Gyeong!

478
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,200
No!

479
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,300
What the? She did call.

480
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,010
What kind of dream is this?

481
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,700
Girlfriend♡

482
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,000
Hello?

483
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,980
What time did you get back home yesterday?

484
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,410
You said you'd call on your way back home. Why didn't you? I'm not trying to get an apology,

485
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,010
but if you're considerate of the person worrying, then you should've called.

486
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,590
I waited all night. But hearing your voice makes me want to see you.

487
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,890
So let's meet and talk right away. I was going to go see you.

488
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,910
You're a very tiring type.

489
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,560
Where are you?

490
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,190
My class is about to start. I'll call you when it's done.

491
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,830
What? Wait.

492
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

493
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,320
Thinking of a face's depth,

494
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,080
you should put more base where it's sticking out

495
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,120
and around delicate areas like mouth and eyes,

496
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,810
you should put just a little bit so the face doesn't look flat, right?

497
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,360
- Yes.
- Now, let's try it on the person next to you.

498
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,300
I received a call. Where is the guy?

499
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,440
Over there. He's totally out.

500
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,030
Gosh, thank you.

501
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,230
Wow. Jun Woo.

502
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,960
Wake up. Grapefruit! Grapefruit!

503
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,980
Did you call me?

504
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,360
- That's my girl.
- Oh my.

505
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,530
Is it not anymore? Since we broke up?

506
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,420
Oh la la?

507
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,930
How can I have you?

508
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,040
Oh dear...

509
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,720
Don't even think about running away and wait right there.

510
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,650
After one year, I'll make you my girl again.

511
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,110
You're killing me.

512
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,030
Buy One Get One free

513
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,530
I got them first.

514
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,220
Let go.

515
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,340
Okay, after you.

516
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,710
- What are you saying?
- Go ahead.

517
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,340
Where have I seen him before?

518
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,520
- Honey, eat this. Nose, nose, nose, mouth!
- C-Co!

519
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,310
Columbus Park! Stop right there!

520
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,060
Columbus, Columbus!

521
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,870
- Stop right there!
- Stop there! Get him!

522
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,020
This way. There you go.

523
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,900
I miss Hui Gyeong.

524
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,330
What do I do? What do I do?

525
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,170
What do I do? Get in somehow.

526
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,770
There you go. You weren't even going to last one day.

527
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,800
Sure, one year.

528
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,180
- Stop right there!
- What's going on?

529
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,670
Please get him! Please get him!

530
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,710
Darn it.

531
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,520
Oh my god...

532
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,480
Thank you.

533
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,570
Mom. Dad.

534
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,310
Hui Gyeong.

535
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,630
Grapefruit!

536
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,680
Oh, Lee Su Ho! You're pretty good.

537
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,330
You came?

538
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,670
- What are you doing on a weekend instead of going on a date?
- Ju Gyeong is busy.

539
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,830
- Are you upset that you couldn't meet her?
- What upset?

540
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,840
No matter how busy she is, why couldn't she meet you?

541
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,630
This face isn't the type that she would already get tired of so quickly, though.

542
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,390
Tired, my butt. Why did you come?

543
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,240
Just because. I was bored.

544
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,170
But why learn martial arts at a dojo? Learn from me.

545
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,580
- What do you know?
- What's the point of learning? Fighting is about senses.

546
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,150
Senses, my butt. It's about technique.

547
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,780
Did you see? This is the sense.

548
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,420
No matter how great your senses are, you won't ever be able to flip over a person who was taught.

549
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,160
- And if I do?
- If you do?

550
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,810
If I flip you over, what are you going to do?

551
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,490
Are you really bored?

552
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,130
The person who flips the other wins.

553
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,700
The loser will need to do everything the winner says.

554
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,350
- How does that sound?
- The pillars on your house are all going to get pulled out though.

555
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,670
Worry about your own house pillars.

556
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,360
Regardless of the rules, the winner is the one doing takedown for three seconds.

557
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,380
Deal.

558
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:53,290
One second, two seconds, two and one-fourth seconds, two and a half seconds.

559
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:57,100
You! You're letting your anger out on me, aren't you?

560
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,480
Three seconds.

561
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,660
See.  You should have let me win.

562
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,020
How is it? Do you want to learn from me?

563
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,590
I'm fine. What do you want me to do?

564
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,760
Tell me quickly.

565
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:49,120
♫ From far away, she is coming.

566
00:42:53,550 --> 00:43:02,690
♫ How should I tell her about this trembling heart?

567
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:10,570
♫ From the start back then

568
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:21,300
♫ My heart was stolen and an incurable disease was given to me.

569
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:28,360
♫ I want to become a flowerpot. I always pray.

570
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:34,800
♫ I want to be a flowerpot that is sitting in your small window.

571
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,680
♫ Even if I can't say anything, even if I can't hope for anything

572
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:48,410
♫ As I receive your smile and your touches every so often

573
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:58,210
♫ I'll be able to endlessly see your sleeping face

574
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:08,520
- Here's the pizza you ordered.
- Thank you.

575
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,070
You will never see me playing a bet against you again.

576
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,100
- Were you hungry?
- Hey, with jujitsu and singing, how could I not become hungry?

577
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,100
By the way, your vocalization wasn't as good as back then.

578
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,510
What are you saying? It's become deeper and more manly.

579
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:29,430
That's what I'm saying. With that deep and manly voice, why aren't you singing?

580
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,400
What can I do now?

581
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,420
- It's not late yet.
- I don't want to.

582
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,300
I would like it if you sang again.

583
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,600
Se Yeon would have wanted that too.

584
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,070
If you won, what would you have said?

585
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,900
- Are you curious?
- Let's just hear it.

586
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,960
I was going to ask if it was okay for me to confess to Im Ju Gyeong.

587
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,660
I was going to get permission to do that.

588
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,290
Confession?

589
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:16,360
Yeah. I was going to get rejected and fold my feelings over for good.

590
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,940
Youth Pizza

591
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,430
But after hearing from him...

592
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,410
He also got his money taken by his boss and seemed to not have any money either.

593
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:36,260
If he had money, would he be in Korea?

594
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,340
He would have already flown over to another country.

595
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:43,260
But because he's been caught by the police, he'll pay for his sins now.

596
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,380
I thought if I caught him, I would be able to find all the money.

597
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,890
- I'm sorry, Honey.
- It's fine!

598
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,580
We should just think of it as all of this was our destiny and fate.

599
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,040
But at least, we avoided all those bullies who harassed Ju Gyeong and moved here.

600
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,830
And on top of that, Hui Gyeong met her other half. Don't you think so?

601
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:07,130
Yeah, Dad. If Ju Gyeong didn't go to Saebom High, I wouldn't have met my grapefruit.

602
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:11,490
But... When will our grapefruit wake up?

603
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:13,720
He keeps sleeping.

604
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,330
- Did you wait long?
- No.

605
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,140
Oh, I should charge my phone.

606
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,940
Did you order this? This looks tasty!

607
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,360
I ordered it so I could eat it.

608
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,410
- What's wrong? Are you angry at me?
- No.

609
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:43,420
- Then are you upset?
- No.

610
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,500
Do I look like someone who would get upset over something small?

611
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,330
Anybody can tell you're upset.

612
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,240
Oh, is that so?

613
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,600
Even with me here, you don't seem all that happy. Then I should leave.

614
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,490
Where are you going?

615
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,520
I shouldn't go?

616
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,470
Then what's wrong? Why are you upset?

617
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,480
Are you really not going to tell me?

618
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,960
You want to ask why? I feel like even after we started dating, we haven't gone on a proper date.

619
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,310
I prepared things after giving it some thought, but you say you're busy and I can't contact you all that much.

620
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,380
And Yoo Tae Hoon, that jerk,  told me that I'm the tiring type.

621
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,910
And Han Seo Jun asked me if he could confess to you.

622
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:24,020
My insides are all a mess right now. I'm getting all burnt up!

623
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,540
- Why?
- I love you.

624
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,290
I love you, Im Ju Gyeong.

625
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,230
If you do it suddenly, then...

626
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,890
Then?

627
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,790
I get nervous.

628
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:44,850
- How was the first lesson? Was it fun?
- Yeah.

629
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,610
Even if it was the beginner's class, everybody except me were like professionals.

630
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:50,030
Turns out I'm the only one who hasn't taken the written test.

631
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,400
So I'm going to try hard and succeed in one try.

632
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,090
After you finish the written test, shall we go somewhere?

633
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,010
- Where?
- Wherever you want.

634
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,570
Then shall we go see the beach?

635
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,280
Take the bus early in the morning and go to see the winter beach. How about it?

636
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,000
Okay. Let's do that.

637
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,470
Can't I really eat this?

638
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,720
- I ordered it for you to eat—
- So you were upset!

639
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:19,160
No, it was for us to eat it together. You and me. You eat and I eat.

640
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,650
I saw that you skipped your private tutoring again.

641
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,480
Even after getting reprimanded last time, you still haven't come to your senses?

642
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,160
Are you rebelling? I'm asking you what the problem is!

643
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:34,400
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

644
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,610
Whether it's because you're skipping out in order to fit in with people of low standards

645
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:42,950
or if it's because you're meeting some guy, I need to confirm for myself.

646
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:45,150
- Take out your phone.
- I don't want to.

647
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,500
Are you not going to take it out quickly?!

648
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:53,070
Have you gone crazy?!

649
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,230
- Did you bring the table out?
- Yeah.

650
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,070
- I'm so hungry.
- So hungry.

651
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:14,470
Dad, here's your rice.

652
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,140
- The soup!
- Bring it here.

653
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,050
Yup~

654
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,210
Grapefruit, come eat.

655
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,800
Thank you for the food.

656
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:32,100
- Eat a lot, Son-in-law Han.
- S-Son-in-law Han?

657
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,240
What Son-in-law Han? She said he's Grapefruit.

658
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,060
- Father, I'm not Grapefruit.
- Father?

659
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:43,040
You do seem like a grapefruit with your red cheeks.

660
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,380
I don't need to call you Teacher at home, right? Hm, Brother-in-law?

661
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,310
You're so dramatic.

662
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,930
Why did you say to break up because of me? Making me uncomfortable.

663
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,910
Starting today, it's the winter break and I'll soon change class years, so it's okay.

664
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,070
Ju Gyeong, I'm quite embarrassed.

665
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:02,190
What embarrassed? You're family now, Son-in-law Han.

666
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,350
Hui Gyeong, what happened to me?

667
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,740
What do you think happened to you?  You're now trapped by me.

668
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,540
Let me clean your eye.

669
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,300
Eat, eat. Eat, Grapefruit.

670
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,180
- Yes, I'll eat well.
- Eat, eat.

671
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,460
Wow, seriously.

672
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,230
Hey, hey, hey.

673
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,750
- Wow, she's here.
- Look at her.

674
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,270
Ju Gyeong, did you look at the bulletin board?

675
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,090
The bulletin board?

676
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,700
She didn't see it?

677
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,890
I didn't know she was that scary.  When everyone is talking about her...

678
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,030
I heard this from the girl's restroom.

679
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,170
Kang Su Jin from Grade 11 Class 5 is goosebumps inducing.

680
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,480
The person who released the video and picture of Im Ju Gyeong was Kang Su Jin.

681
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,560
The two were best friends but she exploded in jealousy over Lee Su Ho and Im Ju Gyeong dating and betrayed her.

682
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,810
I didn't make this up. I saw it firsthand, a different friend confronting Su Jin.

683
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,540
Isn't she like the villain in a drama?

684
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,580
It's not like she's a psychopath. Looks like she's the nation's betrayer.

685
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,940
- Wow, seriously.
- She went too far, really.

686
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,140
- Even so, to a friend?
- Because of a guy, she betrayed her friend?

687
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,010
She's seriously so-so. I didn't see her that way.

688
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:36,530
- Hey, isn't Im Ju Gyeong pitiful?
- That's true.

689
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,860
So the picture of Lee Su Ho and Im Ju Gyeong was also taken secretly by you?

690
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,480
Are you a stalker? Wow, you're so scary.

691
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,130
Kang Su Jin, how will you be able to hold your head high at school now?

692
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:52,670
Well, it's going to be hard for her, to be honest.

693
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:56,500
You think you destroyed Im Ju Gyeong, right?

694
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,880
The one who's destroyed is you.

695
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:02,830
She's totally a stalker.

696
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,840
Su Jin! Su Jin!

697
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,570
Where are you going?

698
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,970
Why are you running away?

699
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,500
You still have nothing to say to me?

700
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,950
You're not even a bit sorry?

701
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:37,160
Nope. I'm not sorry.

702
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:44,840
But still, I don't want us to be like this.

703
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,560
So I decided to hold out my hand for the last time,

704
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,950
because I don't want to regret anything later.

705
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:57,360
Su Jin, let's not be like this.

706
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,150
Do you think I'll hold on to your hand?

707
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:13,900
Did you believe that you and I could go back to how it was back then?

708
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,770
You're Ju Gyeong? Nice to meet you.

709
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,390
♫ I wouldn't know why I'm like this ♫

710
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:43,300
♫ You really drive me crazy ♫

711
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:47,240
♫ Even though I'm busy all day, when I have some time free ♫

712
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,670
♫ I wonder about you ♫

713
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:55,060
♫ I know it's not really playing hard to get, I have the unfamiliar feeling of swooning ♫

714
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,000
♫ I’m feeling good ♫

715
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,970
♫ Iike on the moon ♫

716
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:02,670
♫ I just think I can go anywhere ♫

717
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,530
♫ Now that we are a twosome ♫

718
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:09,750
♫ Call me maybe, you ♫

719
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,810
♫ Make me thrilled again. Love you ♫

720
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:19,470
The 30th National Cosmetology License Written Exam
♫ How far can we go tonight ♫

721
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:22,130
♫ Stay with me ♫

722
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,110
Did you not do well?

723
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,910
It's okay. You can do well next time.

724
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:30,260
I passed!

725
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,480
Good job.

726
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,450
They said I passed.

727
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:36,750
Good job.

728
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,340
I guessed one and it was right.

729
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,250
You got lucky.

730
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,240
You're choking me.

731
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,800
Power of tiger, gush out! Roar!

732
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,990
Is this recyclable?

733
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:58,170
Whatever. Just throw it away.

734
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,670
Im Ju Gyeong

735
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,390
You must feel relieved now that your exam is done.

736
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,000
This is just the start.

737
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,260
I'm told that the written exam isn't even that hard.

738
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,620
Now I have to work hard for the performance exam.

739
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,160
It'll be harder to date now.

740
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,240
You have to study for your exams too.

741
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,980
Come to think of it, you haven't been studying lately.

742
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,310
My mind has been occupied by you.

743
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,300
Just a sec.

744
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:45,500
It's Han Seo Jun.

745
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,080
Hello?

746
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,890
Are you done with the exam?

747
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,130
That's why I'm answering.

748
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:00,930
What's up?

749
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,960
Can I see you right now?

750
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,630
Now?

751
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:09,610
I'm with Lee Su Ho. Should I come with him?

752
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:12,360
No. Just the two of us.

753
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,690
I have something to say.

754
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,830
Then today isn't a good time.

755
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:19,990
Remember my wish card?

756
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:23,730
I'll text you the place. Come there.

757
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,620
Hey, Han Seo Jun.

758
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,750
What the heck?

759
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,740
What did he say?

760
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,590
He has something to tell me and wants to see me,

761
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:37,300
but I'll just meet him some other time.

762
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,160
Go ahead.

763
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,930
- What?
- Go see him.

764
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,320
Han Seo Jun.

765
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,080
Why are you waiting outside when it's so cold?

766
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,150
Your nose is all red.

767
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,000
What is it that's so urgent?

768
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:15,610
Let's just go eat.

769
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,390
You're buying this.

770
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,970
You're using your wish card. You should've eaten something better than this.

771
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:34,280
You like this.

772
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,970
You're right. Honestly, I can eat this all week.

773
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:43,440
But what did you have to tell me?

774
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,900
You didn't call me to have me buy this, right?

775
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,880
I need a relationship advice.

776
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,950
What? Really?

777
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:57,300
But what do I know about relationships?

778
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,450
Just tell me for now. I don't know if I can be any help, though.

779
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,070
I have a crush on someone.

780
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,200
But I'm going to give up.

781
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,730
Why? Did you confess?

782
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,140
No.

783
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,740
You haven't even confessed, yet you're giving up?

784
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:18,080
She has a boyfriend.

785
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,900
Why did it have to be someone with a boyfriend?

786
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,540
Do you like her a lot?

787
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:28,260
Yes. A lot.

788
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,160
Oh no.

789
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,370
Then steal her.

790
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,450
Should I?

791
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:39,200
Who is it? Is she from our school?

792
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,550
I don't know. It's a secret.

793
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:52,650
No way.
